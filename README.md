An attempt to rebuild my knowledge on manipulation and locomotion

## Course Website

Great thanks to Prof. [Russ Tedrake](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/russt.html). My knowledge are out of date, I have to rebuild my knowledge by going through your lectures.   
* **[Underactuated Robotics](https://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/)**: <br> Lecture focusing on locomomtion, i.e. modelling, controls, estimation and learning   
* **[Robotics Manipulation](https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/)**: <br> Lecture focusing on manipulation, i.e. perception, motion planning, dynamics & control, higher level task planning


## Run Jupyter Notebook Locally

* You don't need to git clone **[drake](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake)** and build from source, online **[Jupyter Notebooks](https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/drake.html#notebooks)** are good enough for following the lectures.
* But for engineers in mainland China, it is **strongly recommended** to setup your own local environment to run the Jupyter Notebook. Especially download those github dependencies locally. Gonna save you a lot of time in the long run.  
* Environment Setup
    * I am using ubuntu 20.04 and run these notebook locally on vscode, everything works fine.
    * Follow [this link](https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/drake.html#section3) to run on your own machine. These are the commands I used to setup my environment: 
    * ```bash
        python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install ipykernel
        pip install pydrake
        pip install manipulation --extra-index-url https://drake-packages.csail.mit.edu/whl/nightly/  
        pip install nbformat nbconvert
        ```
    * I created my virtual environment inside vscode extensions, and then do the pip installs. It bypasses several potential module-importing problems. ![selectKernel](./selectKernelVscode.png)
