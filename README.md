An attempt to rebuild my knowledge on manipulation and locomotion

## Course Website

Great thanks to Prof. [Russ Tedrake](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/russt.html)  
* **[Underactuated Robotics](https://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/)**: <br> Lecture focusing on locomomtion, i.e. modelling, controls, estimation and learning   
* **[Robotics Manipulation](https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/)**: <br> Lecture focusing on manipulation, i.e. perception, motion planning, dynamics & control, higher level task planning


## Run Jupyter Notebook locally

* You don't need to git clone **[drake](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake)** and build from source, online **[Jupyter Notebooks](https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/drake.html#notebooks)** are good enough for following the lectures.
* But for engineers in mainland China, it is **strongly recommended** to setup your own local environment to run the Jupyter Notebook. Gonna save you a lot of time in the long run.  
* Follow the procedures in the below link to run on your own PC:

## About this repo
* *Lec_transcripts*: <br>these are lecture transcripts organized GPT4
* *Lec_Notes*: <br> notes taken by myself
* *Lec_ipynb*: <br> Jupyter Notebooks for the lectures


<!-- # Setup Deepnote local environment

git clone git@github.com:RussTedrake/manipulation.git

cd setup/ubuntu/20.04/

sudo ./install_prereqs.sh

sudo pip3 install --ignore-installed manipulation -->
