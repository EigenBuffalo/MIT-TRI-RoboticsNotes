It covers\n","- Writing your own simple dynamical systems,\n","- Simulating a dynamical system and plotting the results,\n","- Constructing a block diagram out of simple systems.\n","\n","Drake includes a set of C++ classes in drake::systems that provide an API for building complex dynamical systems by connecting simple dynamical systems into a block diagram. The modeling approach is inspired by MATLAB's Simulink (though without the graphical user interface). Like Simulink, drake::systems provides a library of existing systems and also makes it easy for you to define your own new dynamical systems. The Python wrappers in `pydrake` used in these notes provide a convenient set of bindings on top of this systems framework, allowing you to write new systems in either Python or C++, and to use them interchangeably.\n","\n","A major difference between modeling dynamical systems in Drake vs Simulink (or most other system modeling languages) is that there is a considerable emphasis in Drake on introspecting the underlying structure in the governing equations. For example, if certain outputs of a dynamical system depend on only a small fraction of the inputs, then we attempt to infer this sparsity directly. Similarly, if the dynamics of a system can be described by a polynomial vector field (or linear, or at least differentiable, ...), then Drake aims to infer this structure as well, and to preserve this structure when systems are combined into a diagram. This structure may have only modest benefit for numerical simulation, but it is incredibly enabling for more sophisticated algorithms for analysis, system identification, and feedback or state estimator design.\n","\n","We'll return to the more advanced modeling tools in a minute, but let us start with some very simple examples.\n","\n","A quick note on documentation. The C++ classes are beautifully documented in [doxygen](http://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx).  The Python API is also [documented](https://drake.mit.edu/pydrake/index.html) directly, but is autogenerated and not always as beautiful.  Consider using the C++ doxygen as a secondary source of documentation even for your Python development... most of the `pydrake` API maps directly to that C++ API.\n","\n","## A library of dynamical systems\n","\n","Drake provides a [rich library of dynamical\n","systems](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__systems.html) for you to\n","build on.  These include primitive systems like integrators and multiplexers,\n","as well as more advanced systems that implement the physics engine, or more\n","advanced algorithms for estimation and control.  As we will see below, these\n","building blocks can be combined into more complicated systems.  However, Drake\n","also makes it easy to write your own systems (in C++ or directly in Python).  \n","\n","## Writing your own dynamics\n","\n","In this section, we will describe how you can write your own dynamics class in `pydrake`. Every user system should derive from the `pydrake.systems.framework.LeafSystem` class.\n","\n","However, many dynamical systems we are interested in are represented by a simple vector field in state-space form, where we often use x to denote the state vector, u for the input vector, and y for the output vector. To make it even easier to implement systems in this form, we provide another subclass `pydrake.systems.primitives.SymbolicVectorSystem` that makes it very easy to author these simple systems.\n","\n","![simpleSystem](./simple_system.png)\n","\n","### Using SymbolicVectorSystem\n","\n","Consider a basic continuous-time, nonlinear, input-output dynamical system described by the following state-space equations: \n","\n","$\\begin{aligned}\\dot{x} =& f(t,x,u), \\\\ y =& g(t,x,u).\\end{aligned}$\n","\n","In `pydrake`, you can instantiate a system of this form where $f()$ and $g()$ are anything that you can write in Python using [operations supported by the Drake symbolic engine](https://drake.mit.edu/pydrake/pydrake.symbolic.html#pydrake.symbolic.Expression), as illustrated by the following example.\n","\n","Consider the system \n","\n","$\\begin{aligned}\\dot{x} =& -x + x^3,\\\\ y =& x.\\end{aligned}$\n","\n","This system has zero inputs, one (continuous) state variable, and one output.

The [`Context`](http://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1systems_1_1_context.html) is a core concept in the Drake systems framework: the `Context` captures all of the (potentially) dynamic information that a `System` requires to implement its core methods: this includes the time, the state, any inputs, and any system parameters.
