Today's Topic: How to stabilize / verify a (Hybrid) limit cycle?
- Stablize on Poincare Map
- Transverse coordinates (moving Poincare Map)
- Transverse LQR/Lyap
- Hybrid Version
- Key message: Orbital stability vs. Trajectory stability
- These days people are especially for quadrupeds with RL rather than Limit Cycles. But if you understand this you will still be a better person.
  - We learned from RL was things like asking for a single controller to work even if the terrain is changing, that makes a big difference. 
  - You have to put all of these in to get these(Limit cycle, Poincare etc) kinds of stronger optimization results out.
