Today's Topic outline
1. Key Idea 1: in high DOFs, we were able to do linearization at fixed point, can we linearize around a non-fixed point? Using some linear tools to linearize along a trajectory--YES
Moving coordinate system and Deriving time varying linearization (powerful tool)
Time-varying LQR, differential Riccadi Equation
2. Receding Horizon control
3. Time-varying LQR
4. Iterative LQR (for traj opt)
